# Hey new users!

This is a Photoshop Script that will allow you to export all of the text layers from your PSD. 

Two version: 

Text Export.jsx - export only text with layer name

Text Export With Style.jsx - export text and it styles (only font-family, font-size and color)

I tested it in Photoshop CC 2018 and it seems to work.

This is based on the https://github.com/omgmog/photoshop-text-export

### Installation

1. Copy `Text Export.jsx` to your Photoshop Scripts folder (`/Applications/Adobe Photoshop CS4/Presets/Scripts/` `c:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Photoshop CC 2018\Presets\Scripts\`)
2. Start (or Re-launch) Photoshop
3. Go to the `File` menu
4. Go to the `Script` menu
5. Click `Text Export` or `Text Export With Style` and select a place to save your output
