# Hey users!

This is a Photoshop Script that will allow you to export psd to text (text layers from your photoshop file). 

## Two version: 

Text Export.jsx - export only text with layer name

Text Export With Style.jsx - export text and it styles (font-family, font-size, line-height and color) 

I tested it in Photoshop CC 2018 and it seems to work.

This is based on the https://github.com/omgmog/photoshop-text-export

### Installation

1. Copy .jsx files to your Photoshop Scripts folder (`/Applications/Adobe Photoshop CS4/Presets/Scripts/` `c:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Photoshop CC 2018\Presets\Scripts\`)
2. Start (or Re-launch) Photoshop
3. Go to the `File` menu
4. Go to the `Script` menu
5. Click `Text Export` or `Text Export With Style` and select a place to save your output
